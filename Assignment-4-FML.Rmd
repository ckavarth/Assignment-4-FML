#Summary:This assignment is to use k-Means for clustering.Variable Selection: Only numerical variables (1 to 9) are chosen for clustering.
#Weights: Equal weights are assigned to each variable to avoid bias towards any particular metric.
#Clustering Algorithm: K-means clustering is used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying clusters in numerical data.
#Number of Clusters: The appropriate number of clusters will be determined using methods such as the elbow method or silhouette score which helps identify the point of diminishing returns in within-cluster sum of squares.Clusters are interpreted based on the average values of numerical variables used in forming the clusters.Characteristics such as market capitalization, beta, PE ratio, return on equity, return on assets, asset turnover, leverage, estimated revenue growth, and net profit margin are analyzed for each cluster.Qualitative variables such as median recommendation, location of firm's headquarters, and stock exchange are examined to identify any discernible patterns.Appropriate names are provided for each cluster based on the characteristics observed in the dataset.Cluster names reflect key features such as market capitalization, leverage, profitability, efficiency, etc.Insights from the cluster analysis provide valuable information about the structure and characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry.
